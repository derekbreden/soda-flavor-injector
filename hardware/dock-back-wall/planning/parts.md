# Dock Back Wall (Cartridge Dock System)

The dock is the enclosure-side structure that receives the removable pump cartridge. This part includes the back wall, floor rails, side guides, and chamfered slot entrance — all elements of the cartridge dock interface.

See `../../planning/architecture.md` for system architecture and `../../planning/spatial-layout.md` for enclosure coordinates.

**Coordinate system:** Enclosure coordinates — origin at exterior front-bottom-left corner of enclosure. X = width (0-220mm). Y = depth (0-300mm). Z = height (0-400mm).

## 3D Printed Part: Dock Back Wall

- **Type:** 3D printed
- **Material:** PETG
- **Envelope:** ~148W x ~10D x ~84H mm
- **Features:**
  - Structural wall at Y=130-140 (behind fully-inserted cartridge)
  - Four 7mm through-holes for 1/4" OD (6.35mm) tube stub pass-throughs with 0.65mm clearance
  - Tube stub spacing: ~40mm horizontal x ~28mm vertical center-to-center (matching cartridge JG fitting positions)
  - Each hole sealed with rubber grommet (7mm ID, ~11mm OD, compression fit into countersunk pocket)
  - Wall thickness at tube holes: 6-8mm
  - Pogo pin mount area on ceiling face (Z=80-84): see `../../pogo-pin-mount/planning/parts.md`
  - Drainage channel on ceiling surface sloping away from pogo pin pockets
- **Interfaces:**
  - Tube stubs protrude from both faces — front into cartridge cavity, rear into valve rack zone
  - Cartridge JG fittings slide onto front-facing tube stubs during dock-in
  - Pogo pins mount to ceiling face
- **Quantity:** 1
- **Open:** Grommet vs O-ring vs adhesive seal

## 3D Printed Part: Dock Floor Rails (x2)
