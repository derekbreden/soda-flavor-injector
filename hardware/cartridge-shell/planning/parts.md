# Cartridge Outer Shell

See `../../planning/cartridge-architecture.md` for cartridge system design rationale.

**Coordinate system:** Origin at exterior front-bottom-left corner of shell. X = width (positive right). Y = depth (positive toward rear/fittings). Z = height (positive up). Front face (Y=0) is cam lever side. Rear face (Y=130) carries JG fittings.

## 3D Printed Part: Outer Shell

- **Type:** 3D printed
- **Material:** PETG
- **Exterior envelope:** 148W x 130D x 80H mm
- **Wall thickness:** 4mm solid (all sides, no ribs)
- **Interior volume:** 140W x 122D x 72H mm
- **Features:**
  - Rectangular box, open on top (lid closes it)
  - Exterior slide rails on bottom face: 2x parallel rails, 2mm tall x 3mm wide, full 130mm depth, spaced to match dock floor rails
  - Exterior side guide contact surfaces: 1.5mm wide rail features on left/right walls, 0.3-0.5mm clearance per side to dock guides
  - Rear wall (Y=126 to Y=130, 4mm thick): 4x fitting pockets for JG PP0408W union bodies in 2x2 grid, 40mm horizontal x 28mm vertical center-to-center. **Barbell profile accommodation (caliper-verified):** The fitting has a 9.31mm center body flanked by 15.10mm body ends. Pocket bore 9.8mm diameter (sliding fit for 9.31mm center body, ~0.25mm clearance per side). The 15.10mm body ends protrude on both sides of the rear wall — the pocket only grips the narrow center section. The center body is 12.16mm long, so the 4mm wall engages a portion of the center section; the fitting shoulders (step-down from 15.10mm to 9.31mm) provide axial location against the wall faces. Through-holes for tube passage (must clear 6.30mm tube OD). Fitting pocket centers at X=54, X=94, Z=26, Z=54 (centered on rear wall). **Note:** The body ends (15.10mm OD) protrude ~12mm on each side of the wall.
  - Rear wall: release plate travel cavity behind fitting pockets, 6mm deep x 63mm wide x 51mm tall (clears 59x47mm plate with 2mm margin per side)
  - Rear wall: 2x guide pin holes for release plate dowel pins (3.0mm diameter press-fit, 10mm deep), positioned at X=40, Z=40 and X=110.5, Z=40
  - Front wall (Y=0 to Y=4, 4mm thick): cam lever pivot hole (5mm diameter, at X=74, Z=40); push rod through-hole (5mm diameter, coaxial)
  - Top face: recessed pocket for pogo target PCB, 15W x 30L x 1.5D mm
  - Top face: wire entry slot from interior to pogo PCB pocket
  - Interior ledges for pump tray: 2x shelves on left/right interior walls, 2mm wide, at Z=4
  - Interior: tray locating tabs or slots on walls for lateral tray alignment
  - Chamfered front edges: 5mm x 45-degree chamfer on all four leading edges (aids dock entry)
- **Interfaces:**
  - Tray screws to shell ledges via 4x M3 heat-set inserts
  - Lid attaches to top via screws or snap clips
  - JG fittings press into rear wall pockets via 9.31mm center body. Collet rings (15.10mm) protrude on both sides of wall.
  - Release plate rides on 2x steel dowel pins mounted in rear wall
  - Cam lever pivots on pin through front wall
  - Pogo target PCB sits in top-face recess
  - Exterior rails and guides mate with dock floor rails and side guides (see `../../dock-back-wall/planning/parts.md`)
- **Quantity:** 1
- **Open:** Interior ledge Z-height depends on final pump tray thickness. Print orientation TBD.
